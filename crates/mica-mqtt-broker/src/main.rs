//! `mica-mqtt-broker` — the MQTT broker the device serves locally.
//!
//! This is rumqttd used as a library, not as its own daemon. It reads the
//! three-key file micad renders into `/run/mica/mqtt-broker.toml`, builds a
//! [`rumqttd::Config`] in code, and blocks in [`rumqttd::Broker::start`].
//!
//! Building the config in code rather than handing rumqttd its own TOML is the
//! point: everything below that is not in the mica-owned file is not a knob.
//! There is no HTTP console, no Prometheus listener, no cluster and no bridge,
//! and none of those can be turned on by editing a file on the device.
