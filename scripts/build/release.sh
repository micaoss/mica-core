# Publish _out/debs/{amd64,arm64}/pool of a clean HEAD for the published GitHub
# Release <tag> of this repository -- its Debian packages and its core components,
# each component two pool items, its image and its record
# (mica-build-tools:docs/spec/release-lock.md 1.2.7):
#   - every archive and every item passes `mica-tools pool guard` against the
#     previous release: a package or component at a released version keeps its
#     inputs hash and its bytes;
#   - `mica-tools release pool` pushes the pools ghcr.io/micaoss/<repository>:pool.<arch>.<tag>,
#     one layer per archive and per item, and reads them back anonymously;
#   - the lock (release, pool, package and item rows) passes `mica-tools lock check`, and
#     `mica-tools release attach` attaches it and SHA256SUMS listing only it, read back
#     anonymously.
# Nothing published is ever replaced.
